* Reverse Nodes in k-Group
  + Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list k at a time and
    returns its modified list
  + If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes in the
    end should remain as it is.
  + You man not alter the values in the nodes, only nodes iteself may be changed.
  + Only constant memory is allowed
  + For example:
    #+begin_example
      Input: "1->2->3->4->5", k = 2

      Output:"2->1->4->3->5"

      Input: "1->2->3->4->5", k = 3

      Output:"3->2->1->4->5"
    #+end_example
