* Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
  + Given a sorted array, remove the duplicates in place such that each element
    appear only once and return the new length.
    Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this in place
    with constant memory.
  + For example:
    #+begin_example
      Input: A = [1,1,2]

      Output: length = 2, A is now [1,2]
    #+end_example
