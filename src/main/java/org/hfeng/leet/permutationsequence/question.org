* Permutation Sequence
  + The set [1,2,3,…,n] contains a total of n! unique permutations.
  + By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order, We get the following
    sequence (ie, for n = 3):
    #+begin_example
      "123"
      "132"
      "213"
      "231"
      "312"
      "321"
    #+end_example
  + Given n and k, return the kth permutation sequence.
  + Note: Given n will be between 1 and 9 inclusive.
