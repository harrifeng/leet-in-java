* Gray Code
  + The gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ
    in only one bit.
  + Given a non-negative integer n representing the total number of bits in the
    code, print the sequence of gray code. A gray code sequence must begin with 0
  + For example, given n = 2, return [0, 1, 3, 2]. Its gray code squence is:
    #+begin_example
      00   - 0
      01   - 1
      11   - 3
      10   - 2
    #+end_example
