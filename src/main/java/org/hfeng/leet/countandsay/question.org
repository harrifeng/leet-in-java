* Count and Say
  + The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integres beginning as follows:
    #+begin_example
      1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221
    #+end_example
  + To explain the string
    - 1 is read off as "one 1" or 11
    - 11 is read off as "two 1s" or 21
    - 21 is read off as "one 2, then one 1", or 1211
  + Given an integer n, generate the nth sequence
  + Note: The sequence of integers will be represented as as string
