* Binary Tree Preorder Traversal
  + Given a binary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes' values
  + Note: Recursive solution is trival, could you do it iteratively?
  + Definition for a binary tree node list here:
    #+begin_src java
      public class TreeNode {
          int val;
          TreeNode left;
          TreeNode right;
          TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
      }
    #+end_src
