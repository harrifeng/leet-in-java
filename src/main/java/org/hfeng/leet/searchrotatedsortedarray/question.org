* Search in Rotated Sorted Array
  + Suppose a sorted array is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand
    #+begin_example
      [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
    #+end_example
  + You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its
    index, otherwise return -1
  + You may assume no duplicate exists in the array
