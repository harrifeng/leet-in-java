* Symmetric Tree
  + Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric around its center).
  + For example, this binary tree is symmetric:
    #+begin_example
          1
         / \
        2   2
       / \ / \
      3  4 4  3
    #+end_example
  + Following is also symmetric:
    #+begin_example
          1
         / \
        2   2
         \ /
         4 4
    #+end_example
  + But the following is not:
    #+begin_example
          1
         / \
        2   2
         \   \
         3    3
    #+end_example
