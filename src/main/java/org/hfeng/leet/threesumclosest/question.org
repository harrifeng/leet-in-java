* Three Sum Closet
  + Given an array S of n integers, find three integers in S such that the sum
    is closest to a given number, target. Return the sum of the three integers.
  + You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.
  + For example,
    #+begin_example
      Input: array S = {-1, 2, 1, -4}, and target = 1
      Output: 2 ==> (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2)
    #+end_example
