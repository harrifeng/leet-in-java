* Longest Consecutive Sequence
  + Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive
    elements sequence.
  + For example:
    #+begin_example
      Input: [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]

      Output: 4 => [1, 2, 3, 4]
    #+end_example
  + Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.
