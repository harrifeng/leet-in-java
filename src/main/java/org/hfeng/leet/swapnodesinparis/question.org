* Swap Nodes in Pairs
  + Given a linked list, swap every two adjacement nodes and return its head
  + For example:
    #+begin_example
      Input: "1->2->3->4"
      Output:"2->1->4->3"
    #+end_example
  + Note: You algorithm should use only constant space. You may *not* modify the
    values in the list, only nodes itself can be changed.
